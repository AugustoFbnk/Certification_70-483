Covariance: A method has a return type that is more derived than that defined 
  Example:
    public delegate TextWriter CovarianceDel();
    public StreamWriter MethodStream() { return null; }
    public StringWriter MethodString() { return null; }
    
    Both StreamWriter and StringWriter inherit from TextWriter

Contravarianec: The delegate parameters can have a less derived types
  Example:
    void DoSomething(TextWriter tw) { }
    public delegate void ContravarianceDel(StreamWriter tw);

    You can passan TextWriter as a parameter even its a more especialized type of StreamWriter

"COVARIANCE makes it possible that a METHOD HAS A RETURN TYPE that is more derived than that defined in the delegate.
CONTRAVARIANCE permits a METHOD HAS A PARAMETER TYPES that are less derived than those in the delegate type"
